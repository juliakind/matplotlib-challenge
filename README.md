2. Although metastatic spread of tumors progressed during the study period, the average number of new cancer sites was significantly lower compared to other drugs as well as placebo. 
3. Capomulin was the only drug which shown tumor reduction after 45 days of the drug trial and the highest survival rate.
4. Ketapril and Infubinol appeared to be ineffective in reducing tumors , as tumors responses to their treatment were the same as response to no treatment.
